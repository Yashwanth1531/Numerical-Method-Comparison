# Numerical Methods Comparison:
This is a repo of python codes for comparing different numerical methods like : Newton-Raphson, Taylor-series, Perturbation-method.
Here, I have implemented all these methods to solve a very simple root-finding problem. Find square-root of 10, for up-to 10 decimal place.

>> Error reults:

N-R          : 0.0
Taylor       : 7.280398506281927e-12
Perturbation : 0.00030447546446810136

where,
Error     = |Excat_sol - Converged_sol|
Excat_sol = 3.1622776601683795
N-R       = Newton-Raphson
