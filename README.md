# Numerical Methods Comparison:

This is a repo of python codes for comparing different numerical methods like : Newton-Raphson, Taylor-series, Perturbation-method.
Here, I have implemented all these methods to solve a very simple root-finding problem. Find square-root of 10, for up-to 10 decimal place.
